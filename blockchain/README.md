# Tonomy Blockchain Easy Cleos Scripts

This guide explains how to use the `create-key.sh` and `transact.sh` scripts in the Tonomy Blockchain Docker environment.

## create-key.sh

This script is used to create a new key pair in the EOSIO blockchain.

### Usage

Access the Docker container:

<!-- bash -->
docker run -it tonomy_blockchain_easycleos ./create-key.sh

After running the script, it will generate a private key. Make note of this private key as it will be required for the `transact.sh` script.

## transact.sh

This script is used to make a transaction in the EOSIO blockchain.

### Usage

Access the Docker container:

<!-- bash -->
docker run -it tonomy_blockchain_easycleos ./transact.sh

When prompted, provide the following inputs:

1. Private Key: [Enter the private key generated by the `create-key.sh` script]
2. Blockchain URL: [Enter the URL of the EOSIO blockchain]
