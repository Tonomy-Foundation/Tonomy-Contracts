## Create a new keypair
This script is used to create a new key pair in the Antelope blockchain.

- docker run -it tonomy_blockchain:easycleos ./create-key.sh

After running the script, it will generate a private key. Store the private key in a very safe place. It will be required for the transact.sh script.

## Sign blockchain transactions
This script is used to make transactions in the Antelope blockchain.

- docker run -it tonomy_blockchain:easycleos ./transact.sh

When prompted, provide the following inputs:

1- Private Key: {{Enter the private key generated by the create-key.sh script}}
2- Blockchain URL: {{Enter the API URL of the Antelope blockchain}}

Then you can type in commands using cleos that will sign transactions. e.g.
cleos transfer gov.tmy opts.tmy 10000.000 LEO "Sending LEO tokens from gov.tmy to ops.tmy account"


## Example
Here's an example of how to create a new key pair and sign a transaction using the scripts mentioned above:

1. docker run -it tonomy_blockchain:easycleos ./create-key.sh
2. docker run -it tonomy_blockchain:easycleos ./transact.sh
    When prompted, 
    Enter Private Key: enter the private key generated in the previous step 
3. alias cleos='cleos -u https://blockchain-api-staging.tonomy.foundation' (change blockchain url accordingly)
4. Use cleos commands For example:
    - To sign transactions:
    cleos transfer ops.tmy gov.tmy "10000.0000 SYS" 

    - Get account information:
    cleos get account gov.tmy

    - Check balance:
    cleos get currency balance eosio.token gov.tmy SYS

For more information on using cleos, refer to the [cleos documentation](https://docs.antelope.io/leap/latest/cleos/).
